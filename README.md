## Context:

A really tiny sushi restaurant. You order and pay at the same time. Then they handle your paid order to the sushi chefs through a standard restaurant order system. Due to obvious regulations you have a limit of 35 people inside the building. If it's raining they have way less movement than the usual, because there's no shelter.
